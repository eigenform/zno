The front-end of a modern microprocessor is mostly concerned with keeping
a constant stream of instructions moving into the machine. 

[Branch Prediction](./bpred.md) attempts to keep relevant instructions
moving through the machine by predicting the next set of instructions.

[Instruction Fetch](./fetch.md) retrieves instructions from memory. 

[Instruction Predecode](./predecode.md) attempts to discover special 
instructions that must be handled early in the pipeline.

[Instruction Decode](./decode.md) transforms instructions into macro-ops.
